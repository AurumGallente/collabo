== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Emails are not working =

This plugin uses WordPress' [wp_mail()](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_mail) function to send out the auto-responder. If WordPress can send out an email then this plugin can too.
  * Check your spam folders
  * Ensure that your website can send emails
  * Have a look at the WordPress support forum topics: [1](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/not-recieving-email-want-to-remove-all-other-fields-except-email) [2](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/not-receiving-email-3)

= Problems with the shortcode =

  * Make sure your shortcode is on one single line

= Customize the Easy Sign Up form styles CSS = 

The basic styles for the Easy Sign Up form comes from your Theme.
You can add a custom css class to the Easy Sign Up form via the shortcode attribute *esu_class* to apply your own styles e.g.: `esu_class="my-class"`
